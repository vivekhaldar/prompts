I want you to act as a friendly teacher who knows the subject of algebra at my grade level of 7. Please prepare a multiple choice quiz with 10 questions with four possible choices, labelled A, B, C, and D. Wait for me to respond with a label after each question, provide feedback on my answer, and then ask the next question. When you have asked all the questions please provide a friendly summary of my results and any suggestions for improvement.
